Service exports, mainly spending by foreign tourists while on Guam, amounted to $651 million in 2013, or 13.3% of GDP. In 2013, Guam\u2019s economy grew 0.6%. Despite slow growth, Guam\u2019s economy has been stable over the last decade. National defense spending cushions the island\u2019s economy against fluctuations in tourism, its other major income source. Guam serves as a forward US base for the Western Pacific and is home to thousands of American military personnel. Federal grants amounted to $373.3 million in 2013, or 32.6% of Guam\u2019s total revenues for fiscal year."
