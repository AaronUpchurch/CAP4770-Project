  "Introduction ": {
    "Background": {
      "text": "The Sunni-led government has long struggled to manage relations with its large Shia-majority population. In early 2011, amid Arab uprisings elsewhere in the region, the Bahraini Government confronted similar pro-democracy and reform protests at home with police and military action, including deploying Gulf Cooperation Council security forces to Bahrain. Political talks throughout 2014 between the government and opposition and loyalist political groups failed to reach an agreement, prompting opposition political societies to boycott parliamentary and municipal council elections in late 2014. Ongoing dissatisfaction with the political status quo continues to factor into sporadic clashes between demonstrators and security forces."

In addition to addressing its current fiscal woes, Bahraini authorities face the long-term challenge of boosting Bahrain\u2019s regional competitiveness \u2014 especially regarding industry, finance, and tourism \u2014 and reconciling revenue constraints with popular pressure to maintain generous state subsidies and a large public sector. Over the past year, the government lifted subsidies on meat, diesel, kerosene, and gasoline and announced new higher prices for electricity and water, although it plans to roll these increases out more gradually than previous subsidy cuts."
