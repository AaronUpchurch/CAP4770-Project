    "Background": {
      "text": "Illicit migration of Cuban nationals to the US via maritime and overland routes has been a longstanding challenge. In FY 2016, the US Coast Guard interdicted 5,228 Cuban nationals at sea. Also in FY 2016, 44,553 Cuban migrants presented themselves at various land border ports of entry throughout the US. On 12 January 2017, the US and Cuba signed a Joint Statement ending the so-called \u201cwet-foot, dry-foot\u201d policy \u2013 by which Cuban nationals who reached US soil were permitted to stay \u2013 facilitating the repatriation of Cuban migrants. Illicit Cuban migration has since dropped significantly."
