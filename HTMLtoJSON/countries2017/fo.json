    "Background": {
      "text": "The population of the Faroe Islands is largely descended from Viking settlers who arrived in the 9th century. The islands have been connected politically to Denmark since the 14th century. A high degree of self-government was granted the Faroese in 1948, who have autonomy over most internal affairs while Denmark is responsible for justice, defense, and foreign affairs. The Faroe Islands are not part of the European Union."

The local government intends to use this to reduce public debt, which reached 38% of GDP in 2015. Increasing public infrastructure investments are likely to lead to continued growth in the short term, but could contribute to overheating the economy. Signs of overheating led the Danish Central Bank in fall of 2016 to advise the Faroese local government to initiate measures to cool the economy, including postponing spending on infrastructure spending. The local government is planning to allocate part of the expected public surplus to a business-cycle-equalization fund."
