Guam serves as a forward US base for the Western Pacific and is home to thousands of American military personnel. Total federal spending (defense and non-defense) amounted to $1.973 billion in 2014, or 40.4% of GDP. Of that total, federal grants amounted to $373.3 million in 2013, or 32.6% of Guam\u2019s total revenues for the fiscal year. Service exports, mainly spending by foreign tourists to Guam, amounted to $651 million in 2013, or 13.3% of GDP. In 2013, Guam\u2019s economy grew 0.6%. Despite slow growth, Guam\u2019s economy has been stable over the last decade. National defense spending cushions the island\u2019s economy against fluctuations in tourism."
