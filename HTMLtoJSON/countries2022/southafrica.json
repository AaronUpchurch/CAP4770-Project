    "Background": {
      "text": "The first multi-racial elections in 1994 following the end of apartheid ushered in majority rule under an ANC-led government. South Africa has since struggled to address apartheid-era imbalances in wealth, housing, education, and health care. Jacob ZUMA became president in 2009 and was reelected in 2014, but resigned in February 2018 after numerous corruption scandals and gains by opposition parties in municipal elections in 2016. His successor, Cyril RAMAPHOSA, has made some progress in reigning in corruption, though many challenges persist. In May 2019 national elections, the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sixth since the end of apartheid, the ANC won a majority of parliamentary seats, delivering RAMAPHOSA a five-year term."

The government faces growing pressure from urban constituencies to improve the delivery of basic services to low-income areas, to increase job growth, and to provide university level-education at affordable prices. Political infighting among South Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruling party and the volatility of the rand risks economic growth. International investors are concerned about the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term economic stability; in late 2016, most major international credit ratings agencies downgraded South Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s international debt to junk bond status."
