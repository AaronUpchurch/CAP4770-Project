    "Background": {
      "text": "Ibrahim Boubacar KEITA won the Malian presidential elections in 2013 and 2018. Aside from security and logistic shortfalls, international observers deemed these elections credible. Terrorism, banditry, ethnic-based violence, and extra-judicial military killings plagued the country during KEITA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second term. In August 2020, the military arrested KEITA, his prime minister, and other senior members of the government and established a military junta called the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP). In September 2020, the junta established a transition government and appointed Bah N\u00e2\u0080\u0099DAW, a retired army officer and former defense minister, as interim president and Colonel Assimi GOITA, the coup leader and chairman of the CNSP, as interim vice president. The transition government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s charter allows it to rule for up to 18 months before calling a general election. \u00c2\u00a0In May 2021, Colonel Assimi GOITA arrested the interim president in a second coup in an effort to slow election preparations, claiming that the transition government needed to prioritize improving security before elections occur. In June 2021, Mali\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military transitional leaders appointed Choguel Kokalla MAIGA as prime minister."

Most of those displaced domestically sought shelter in urban areas of southern Mali, except for pastoralist and nomadic groups, who abandoned their traditional routes, gave away or sold their livestock, and dispersed into the deserts of northern Mali or crossed into neighboring countries. Almost all Malians who took refuge abroad (mostly Tuareg and Maure pastoralists) stayed in the region, largely in Mauritania, Niger, and Burkina Faso."

Higher rainfall helped to boost cotton output in 2017, and the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2017 budget increased spending more than 10%, much of which was devoted to infrastructure and agriculture.
